==================
Simple Laptop Case
==================

These files are the start of a (planned) simple laptop-style case for the novena. Being derived in part from the original novena CAD, non-software components of this work are licensed under the CERN OHL v1.2. Software components are unlicensed under the UNLICENSE.

Notes
-----

- Senoko sits 1.2mm lower than novena
- SD card cutout position is currently just a guess and needs to be fixed
- kerf is tunable - use the variable "k" to offset the laser path from the desired edge
